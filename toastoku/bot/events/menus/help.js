                    -# ∘ The button turns **green** to show that notes are enabled.
                    -# ∘ While enabled, pressing numbers **1-9** adds them as notes to the selected cell instead of filling it.
                    -# ∘ You remain in the selected cell while adding notes, allowing multiple numbers to be added quickly.

                  -# **Disabling Notes**
                    -# ∘ Press the pencil mode button again to disable notes.
                    -# ∘ Notes mode also automatically disables if you leave the cell using the **Back to Cell** button.
                    -# ∘ Once disabled, pressing numbers **fills the cell** as usual.

                  -# **Automatic Note Updates**
                    -# ∘ If you insert a number into a cell, any conflicting notes in the **same row, column, or 3x3 grid** are automatically removed.
                    -# ∘ Example: If a cell has notes **2, 3, 4** and you enter **4** in another cell in the same row, column, or grid, the **4** is removed from the notes in that cell.
                    -# ∘ This ensures your notes stay accurate and up to date while solving the puzzle.

                    -# ∘ Hints automatically fill a correct number in the puzzle to help you progress.
                    -# ∘ Server administrators can toggle this feature on or off whenever they want!

                  -# **How Hints Work**
                    -# ∘ If you select a specific cell, that cell is filled with the correct number.
                    -# ∘ You are returned to the cell selection screen, and the filled number counts as a **prefilled spot**.
                    -# ∘ Numbers provided by hints are greyed out and cannot be changed.
                    -# ∘ If no specific cell is selected within a grid, a random empty spot in that grid is filled.
                    -# ∘ If the chosen grid is full or no grid is selected, a random empty cell anywhere in the puzzle is filled.

                  **Server-Specific Settings**
                  -# **Toggling Hints**
                    -# ∘ Users with **Manage Guild** permissions can toggle the ability of using hints.
                    -# ∘ You can manage this by using **/server settings edit**.
                    -# ∘ You can also manage this on the **Dashboard** after logging in, via the Manage Server section.

                  **Tips & Tricks**
                  -# ∘ Use hints wisely, they solve a cell but count as prefilled, which can help or limit you later.
                  -# ∘ If stuck, use a hint in the smaller sections of the puzzle to avoid overwriting too many options.
                  -# ∘ Remember that hints need to be turned on in the server you're in, else it won't work.
                  -# ∘ Combine hints with pencil mode to mark possibilities before committing to a number.
                  -# ∘ You get 3 hints a day, but you can earn more through bonuses, quests and challenges!

                    -# ∘ Completing the daily puzzle grants a reward to the player who finishes it.
                    -# ∘ Both the reward amount and type are randomized each day, keeping things exciting.
                    -# ∘ Everyone has the same puzzle, so you can compare completion times and scores with friends.

                  **Tips & Tricks**
                  -# ∘ Keep an eye on the Community Goal to know what everyone is working towards.
                  -# ∘ If a goal is close to completion, focus your gameplay on that goal to maximize rewards.

                  -# ∘ Plan your moves: contributing strategically to goals can save time and increase efficiency.
                  -# ∘ Check progress early, sometimes your contribution might be just enough to trigger the reward.
                  -# ∘ For Daily Challenges, focus on sections you’re strongest at first, then fill in harder areas.
                  -# ∘ Don’t be afraid to experiment with different strategies, each puzzle may need a new approach.
